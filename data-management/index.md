## Internal Data Storage

All research data **must first be stored in the internal repository** before any external sharing.

### Internal Repository
**OneDrive – Internal Repository – Science**

---

## Folder Structure

Use the following mandatory folder structure:

Internal Repository – Science / WP / Task / DatasetName /

---

## Required Files

Each dataset folder **must contain** the following files:

- **README.md**  
  Description of the dataset, purpose, creator, and context

- **Data Dictionary**  
  Explanation of variables, columns, codes, and formats

- **Data files**  
  The actual dataset files (CSV, XLSX, JSON, etc.)

- **Anonymisation notes**  
  Description of anonymisation steps (or justification if not applicable)

---

## Notification Requirement

After uploading your dataset to the internal repository,  
**inform the Data Manager** that the dataset is available.

# Sharing Data Related to Publications (Zenodo)

After internal storage, datasets that **support a publication** may be uploaded to **Zenodo**, provided that:

- the data do **not contain sensitive information**, and
- the data are **fully anonymised** or cannot be re-identified.

Zenodo provides:

- **FAIR compliance**
- **DOI assignment**
- **Long-term preservation**
- **Connection to the DigiWELL Zenodo community**

---

## Step-by-Step Guide: Uploading Data to Zenodo

### Step 1: Prepare the Dataset
Before uploading, ensure that:
- the dataset is final and consistent with the publication
- all sensitive or personal data have been removed or anonymised
- required documentation files are ready (README, data dictionary)

---

### Step 2: Log in to Zenodo
1. Go to **https://zenodo.org**
2. Click **Log in**
3. Use your **ORCID** or institutional account (recommended)

---

### Step 3: Start a New Upload
1. Click **New Upload**
2. Select **Upload dataset**

---

### Step 4: Upload Files
1. Upload:
   - dataset files
   - README
   - data dictionary
2. Verify that filenames are clear and meaningful

---

### Step 5: Fill in Metadata (Mandatory)
Complete all required metadata fields:

- **Title** – clear and descriptive
- **Authors** – consistent with the publication
- **Description** – short summary of the dataset and its purpose
- **Keywords** – relevant scientific terms
- **Funding** – include OP JAK / DigiWELL funding information

---

### Step 6: Select Licence
- Recommended licence: **CC BY 4.0**
- Use a more restrictive licence **only if justified**

---

### Step 7: Assign to DigiWELL Community
1. In the **Communities** section:
   - search for **DigiWELL**
   - add the dataset to the **DigiWELL Zenodo Community**

---

### Step 8: Publish and Obtain DOI
1. Click **Publish**
2. Zenodo will assign a **DOI**
3. Record the DOI for:
   - the publication
   - internal records
   - OP JAK reporting

---

## Final Step: Inform the Team
After publication on Zenodo:
- inform the **Data Manager**
- provide:
  - dataset title
  - Zenodo DOI
  - related publication reference

---

## Notes
When in doubt about data sensitivity, licensing, or compliance,  
**consult the Open Science or Data Management team before publishing**.
