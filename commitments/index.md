title: Open Science Commitments
---

The **DigiWELL project** fully implements the principles of **Open Science** in accordance with European Commission recommendations and OP JAK requirements.

Our approach combines **mandatory Open Access obligations** with **advanced open research practices** that enhance transparency, reproducibility, and public engagement.

---

## Core Open Science Principles

### Mandatory Open Access
- All publications are published under **Open Access**
- **91%** via APC funding
- Remaining outputs via **Read & Publish agreements**

---

### Optional and Advanced Open Practices
Where scientifically and ethically appropriate, DigiWELL promotes:

- **Preregistration** of studies
- **Preprints** (where publisher policies allow)
- **Open Peer Review**
- **Citizen Science** approaches

---

### Sharing of Research Assets
- Open sharing of:
  - methodologies
  - algorithms
  - software
  - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Archiving of:
  - research protocols
  - analysis scripts
- Support for **computational and methodological reproducibility**

---

### Public and Stakeholder Involvement
- Participatory development of:
  - research tools
  - questionnaires
  - digital interventions
- Engagement of non-academic stakeholders where relevant

---

  - OSF
  - ClinicalTrials.gov (where applicable)
- Open Peer Review when available

---

### WP5 – Applied Outputs & Policy Impact
- Open Peer Review

  - questionnaire development
  - application development
- SOPs and detailed documentation for applied outputs

---

### WP6 – Complex Data & Statistical Methods

---

## Final Note
Open Science practices are implemented with full respect to:
- ethical standards
- data protection regulations
- participant consent
- intellectual property considerations

When conflicts arise, **responsible research conduct takes precedence over openness**.
