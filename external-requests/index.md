title: Handling External Data Requests
---

This page describes the **mandatory procedure** for handling requests from **external researchers, institutions, or organisations** seeking access to DigiWELL data.

All external data requests must follow the process below.  
**No data may be shared informally or ad hoc.**

---

## Step-by-Step Process for External Data Requests

### Step 1: Redirect the Requester
If you receive a data request directly (email, meeting, informal contact):

- Do **not** share any data
- Redirect the requester to the **official Data Request Form**
- Inform them that all requests must go through formal evaluation

---

### Step 2: Initial Screening
The **Data Manager** performs an initial screening to verify:

- completeness of the request
- clarity of research purpose
- requested data scope
- preliminary legal and ethical feasibility

Incomplete requests may be returned for clarification.

---

### Step 3: Evaluation by the Data Access Committee (DAC)
The **Data Access Committee (DAC)** evaluates the request, considering:

- legal compliance
- ethical implications
- data protection requirements
- scientific validity
- institutional and project interests

---

### Step 4: Decision Outcome
The request will result in one of the following outcomes:

- **Approved**  
- **Request more information**  
- **Denied**

---

### Step 5: Communication and Data Sharing
The **Data Manager**:

- communicates the official decision to the requester
- coordinates data preparation and sharing **only if approved**
- ensures appropriate agreements are in place (if required)

---

## Legal & Ethical Grounds for Declining Requests

A request may be **fully or partially denied** for reasons including, but not limited to:

- **Privacy protection**
- **Personal data restrictions (GDPR)**
- **Trade secrets**
- **Scientific integrity risks**
- **Commercial sensitivity**
- **Security concerns**
- **Incompatibility with original consent or project scope**

Decisions are documented for accountability and audit purposes.

---

## Key Principles

- External data sharing is **exceptional**, not automatic
- All decisions must be:
  - documented
  - traceable
  - justifiable
- When in doubt, **data are not shared**

---

## Important Note
No member of the DigiWELL team is authorised to share data externally  
**without approval through this process**.

Questions or uncertainties must be escalated to:
- the **Data Steward**
- the **Data Manager**
- or the **Data Access Committee**
