## News 2026: Update to Open Science Rules (MŠMT)

In **January 2026**, DigiWELL formally adopted its internal Open Science rules.  
Subsequently, the **Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MŠMT)** issued a **new methodological letter** clarifying and partially updating the Open Science chapter within the rules for **Špičkový výzkum**.

The updated interpretation has been **approved by MŠMT**.  
DigiWELL intends to **adopt this updated methodology** and, if required, will submit a **formal request for change** in accordance with project rules.

Importantly, the **obligation to apply the CC BY licence remains unchanged**.

### 1. Open Access Obligation for Publications

The methodological letter **clarifies and specifies** which publication outputs must be deposited and under what conditions.

**New specification:**
- Applies to publication outputs of type **J – peer-reviewed scholarly articles**
- Categories explicitly include:
  - *article*
  - *review*
  - *letter*
- Open Access must be:
  - **immediate (no embargo)**
  - provided under **Creative Commons Attribution International (CC BY 4.0)**

**Important clarification:**  
If a publisher does **not allow CC BY**, a **more restrictive licence is permitted**, provided that:
- the article is deposited in a repository
- access is **immediate and open**

### 2. Rights Retention Strategy (Author Copyrights)

The methodological letter explicitly strengthens the **rights retention requirement** to prevent conflicts with publisher contracts.

**Newly emphasised rule:**
> “The beneficiary (or authors) must retain sufficient copyright to fulfil Open Science obligations.  
> When concluding a licence agreement with a publisher, authors must not transfer exclusive rights and may only grant a non-exclusive licence.”

**Practical impact:**  
Researchers must avoid signing agreements that would prevent repository deposition or Open Access compliance.

### 3. Documentation of Indicators (214 021 – Publications)

A significant administrative clarification affects reporting in **Reports on Implementation (ZoR)**.

**Previous practice:**  
A link to the publisher’s website was often sufficient.

**New requirement:**  
> The publication list must include a **persistent URL or DOI (as URL)** pointing to a **trusted repository** containing:
> - full text files
> - complete metadata  
> (mandatory for J-type publications: *article*, *review*, *letter*)

**Practical impact:**  
Links to publisher websites alone are **no longer sufficient**.

## DigiWELL Position

- DigiWELL **supports and adopts** the clarified Open Science interpretation.
- The updated methodology is **aligned with existing DigiWELL Open Science principles**.
- Where required, a **formal request for change** will be submitted to ensure full procedural compliance.
- The **CC BY obligation remains fully in force**.

## Final Note

These updates strengthen legal certainty, reduce administrative ambiguity, and support responsible Open Science practices while preserving flexibility for complex research projects.
