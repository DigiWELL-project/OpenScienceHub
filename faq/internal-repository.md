title: "Do I have to store my data in the internal repository? Why?"
---

Yes.  
Every dataset produced within the DigiWELL project must first be stored in the internal repository (**OneDrive – Internal Repository – Science**).

### Why is this required?
- Mandatory internal rule  
- Ensures access for other DigiWELL researchers  
- Protects project continuity  
- Allows the Data Manager to verify:
  - metadata  
  - documentation  
  - anonymisation  
  - folder structure  
- Supports FAIR principles  
- Internal storage is the official archive before public sharing
