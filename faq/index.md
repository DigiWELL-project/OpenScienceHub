## Frequently Asked Questions

This section answers the most common questions related to **data storage, sharing, and Open Science practices** within the DigiWELL project.

---

## Do I have to store my data in the internal repository? Why?

**Yes.**

Every dataset produced within the **DigiWELL project** must first be stored in the internal repository:

**OneDrive – Internal Repository – Science**

### Why is this required?
- It is a **mandatory internal rule**
- Ensures access for other DigiWELL researchers
- Protects project continuity
- Allows the **Data Manager** to verify:
  - metadata
  - documentation
  - anonymisation
  - folder structure
- Supports **FAIR principles**

Internal storage is the **official archive** before any public or external data sharing.

---

### Upload to Zenodo is NOT required when:
- sensitive data **cannot be sufficiently anonymised**
- **GDPR or privacy regulations** would be violated
- trade secrets or commercial information are involved
- data release would compromise **scientific strategy or ongoing research**

---

## Why Zenodo?

Zenodo is the recommended repository because it provides:

- **FAIR compliance**
- **DOI assignment**
- **Long-term preservation**
- Official **DigiWELL Zenodo community**
- Recognition by:
  - scientific journals
  - funders
  - Open Access and Open Science policies

## Final Note
When in doubt about whether data should be shared publicly,  
**consult the Data Manager or Open Science team before uploading**.
